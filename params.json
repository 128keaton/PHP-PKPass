{"body":"# PHP PKPass class for iOS 6 Passbook\r\nThis class provides the functionality to create an Pass for Passbook in Apple's iOS 6 and newer on-the-fly. It creates, signs and packages the Pass as a .pkpass file according to Apple's documentation.\r\n\r\nPlease also take a look at [my repository PHP-Passkit](https://github.com/tschoffelen/PHP-Passkit), which includes the PKTemplate and PKValidate classes, to easily manage templates and validate pass files.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* PHP 5\r\n* PHP [ZIP Support](http://php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php) (May be installed by default)\r\n* Access to filesystem (Script must be able to create temporary folders)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nPlease take a look at the example.php file for example usage. For more info on the JSON for the pass and how to style it, take a look at the [docs at developers.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Reference/PassKit_Bundle/Chapters/Introduction.html).\r\n\r\nA live demo of the full sample can be found on [http://www.tomttb.com/test/pass/full_sample](http://www.tomttb.com/test/pass/full_sample) (Sorry, outdated at the moment...).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requesting the Pass Certificate\r\n1. Go to the [iOS Provisioning portal](https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/passtypeids/ios/manage)\r\n2. Create a new Pass Type ID\r\n3. Request the certificate like shown\r\n4. Download the .cer file and drag it into Keychain Access\r\n5. Right click the certificate in Keychain Access and choose `Export 'pass.<id>'â€¦`\r\n6. Choose a password and export the file to a folder\r\n\r\n### Getting the example.php sample to work\r\n1. Request the Pass certificate (`.p12`) and upload it to your server\r\n2. Set the correct path and password on [line 6 and 7](https://github.com/tschoffelen/PHP-PKPass/blob/master/example.php#L6)\r\n3. Download and import your [WWDR Intermediate certificate](https://developer.apple.com/certificationauthority/AppleWWDRCA.cer) to Keychain, export as `.pem` and set the correct path on [line 8](https://github.com/tschoffelen/PHP-PKPass/blob/master/example.php#L8)\r\n4. Change the `passTypeIdentifier` and `teamIndentifier` to the correct values, which can be found on the [iOS Provisioning portal](https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/passtypeids/ios/manage) after clicking on 'Configure' next to the Pass ID, on line [11](https://github.com/tschoffelen/PHP-PKPass/blob/master/example.php#L10) and [15](https://github.com/tschoffelen/PHP-PKPass/blob/master/example.php#L14)\r\n\r\nAfter completing these steps, you should be ready to go. Upload all the files to your server and navigate to the address of the example.php file on your iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nFor info, mail me at tom@tomttb.com or tweet me [@tschoffelen](http://www.twitter.com/tschoffelen).\r\n","google":"UA-35084343-1","tagline":"A PHP class for creating a Pass for Passbook in iOS 6.
